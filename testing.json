So, soon after discovering the workshop\u2019s existence we had our tickets and travel all arranged to attend one of these phenomenal education experiences.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On Saturday 2, September we escaped the thunderstorms and rain of Zurich and headed off to sunny Paris. Blessed with lovely weather, we spent our free time exploring the picturesque city and experiencing the local culture.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Monday marked the start of an intense and awesome 2-day workshop. As these events are limited to a maximum of 40 people this allowed us to have invaluable one-on-one learning time with the motion design superstars.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The action-packed program covered the best of the best in terms of the latest and greatest technologies and animation frameworks. This included an in-depth look at animating with CSS, JavaScript (specifically GSAP), and SVG through hands-on exercises as well as a strong focus on animating with React.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After the two days of practical and technical learning, surrounded by fellow motion enthusiasts, we returned to our Airbnb overflowing with inspiration and determination. This lead to an all-nighter full of experimenting with what we had learned from the workshop. We created a variety of immersive and invisible animations, raced bezier curves against one another (this is an animator joke, they always finish at the same time) and occasionally shouted the word \u201cButtons!\u201d* in a high pitched voice.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of our creations from that night was an SVG animation of the Drupal Logo morphing and drawing into the Zurich coat of arms. The inspiration behind this immersive animation was the Drupal User Group Meetup which we presented at on the Thursday. Below you can see the CodePen for this animation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"552\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"\/\/codepen.io\/lisa-thesen\/embed\/WEWzEx\/?height=552&amp;theme-id=0&amp;default-tab=result&amp;embed-version=2\" style=\"width: 100%;\" title=\"Drupal Zurich\">See the Pen &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a data-cke-saved-href='https:\/\/codepen.io\/lisa-thesen\/pen\/WEWzEx\/' href='https:\/\/codepen.io\/lisa-thesen\/pen\/WEWzEx\/'&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Drupal Zurich&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;\/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; by Lisa Thesen (&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a data-cke-saved-href='https:\/\/codepen.io\/lisa-thesen' href='https:\/\/codepen.io\/lisa-thesen'&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;@lisa-thesen&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;\/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;) on &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a data-cke-saved-href='https:\/\/codepen.io' href='https:\/\/codepen.io'&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;CodePen&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;\/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;.<\/iframe><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ultimately, we had an incredible time and the workshop was mind-blowing.

Die Organisation ist ausschliesslich durch externe Finanzierung&nbsp;gewachsen und nun gewinnt sie schon nationale Abstimmungen. Dies, indem Operation Libero ihre politischen Anliegen durch soziale Medien vokalisiert. Wie das genau funktioniert und was das Geheimnis zum Erfolg ist, erkl\u00e4rte uns heute Silvan Gisler.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Laut Silvan ist man online \u00absein eigenes Medium\u00bb und kann also so wie die NZZ oder den Tages Anzeiger Neuigkeiten und Fakten pr\u00e4sentieren. Damit tr\u00e4gt man eine grosse Verantwortung und braucht eine Strategie.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Es gilt: Qualit\u00e4t vor Quantit\u00e4t. Ein relevantes und interessantes Thema zu finden und daraus guten Content zu erschaffen&nbsp;steht bei der Operation Libero im Vordergrund.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Der Inhalt soll nicht nur ansprechen, sondern auch einen \u00abcall-to-action\u00bb beinhalten und gut mit allen anderen Plattformen (Website, Mailing liste etc.) vernetzt sein. Der Kernpunkt: Qualitativ hoher Inhalt, der den Konsumenten dazu zu bringt, mit dieser Information zu agieren.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bei Operation Libero&nbsp;wird wenig in Facebook Werbung investiert, es steht die organische Reichweite an erster Stelle. Die Kampagne muss die gew\u00fcnschte Zielgruppe ansprechen, nur dann teilt diese den Beitrag auch. F\u00fcr Operation Libero ist somit ein oft geteilter Beitrag ein erfolgreicher Beitrag. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<img alt=\"Zeigt Sushil Aerthott\" data-align=\"center\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"3ed26c77-45db-4afe-bc00-e22965aca098\" src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/inline-images\/36252113173_3ba8df842a_o.jpg\" \/>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http:\/\/amazeelabszrh.cmail20.com\/t\/r-i-jlthykjl-l-h\/\" target=\"_blank\">Sushil Aerthott<\/a> ist Projektleiter f\u00fcr Online-Kommunikation bei<a href=\"http:\/\/amazeelabszrh.cmail20.com\/t\/r-i-jlthykjl-l-o\/\" target=\"_blank\"> economiesuisse<\/a>. Der Dachverband der Schweizer Wirtschaft nutzt im Kommunikationsmix unter anderem Social Media, um langfristige Beziehungen zu politischen Entscheidungstr\u00e4gern aufzubauen und zu pflegen. F\u00fcr Sushil gibt es 5 grunds\u00e4tzliche Punkte zu politischen Onlinekampagnen:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1. Das Ziel bestimmt alles<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bevor eine Kampagne beginnt, muss man wissen was man bewirken will. Wer ist die Zielgruppe&nbsp;und wie muss man eine Kampagne anpassen, um ihr gerecht zu werden? F\u00fcr economiesuisse liegt der Fokus \u00abnicht nur auf dem urbanen Z\u00fcrich\u00bb, sondern auf der ganzen Schweiz, und das in allen Landessprachen.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2. Gefunden werden<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wie man Menschen erreicht&nbsp;hat sich mit der Evolution der Medien ver\u00e4ndert. Es bringt nichts, jemanden der eine andere Meinung hat, \u00fcberzeugen zu wollen. Es braucht also Menschen, die Ihre Ansichten teilen. Eine Kampagne muss nicht alle ansprechen, sondern aufs Individuum fokussiert sein. Je individualisierter Kommunikation also ist, umso offener ist der Mensch ihr gegen\u00fcber.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3. Einstieg erm\u00f6glichen<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00abImmer weniger Menschen sind bereit viel zu tun, immer mehr sind bereit wenig zu tun.\u00bb Somit soll man einfache L\u00f6sungen anbieten, die nicht viel Zeit oder Aufwand kosten.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">4. Die Macht der N\u00e4he sp\u00fcren<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wer Engagement zeigt, soll auch Aufmerksamkeit bekommen. Wertsch\u00e4tzung gegen\u00fcber dem Kunden macht sich langfristig bezahlt.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">5. Aktionen starten<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Die Engagement-Pyramide von economiesuisse zeigt die verschiedenen Stufen der Zielgruppe und ihr Engagement f\u00fcr Kampagnen auf. Je nach Stufe verlangt dies nach entsprechenden Aktionen, um die Zielgruppe stufenweise zu mehr Engagement zu f\u00fchren.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Vielen Dank an unsere beiden Redner f\u00fcr diese inspirierenden Einsichten!<\/p>\r\n<img alt=\"Foto vom Publikum\" data-align=\"center\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"e0d1db1c-d6e9-4485-ae03-035065844052\" src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/inline-images\/36918246941_e72f3658a6_o.jpg\" \/><img alt=\"Foto von einer Besucherin im Gespr\u00e4ch\" data-align=\"center\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"6414c345-5995-4bf8-8d00-b6eb8cc4a946\" src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/inline-images\/36224769854_105a6943c3_o.jpg\" \/><img alt=\"Foto vom Publikum\" data-align=\"center\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"ec9e6db3-426a-4e4f-863c-6023b7dbe9fd\" src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/inline-images\/36224774354_19298c8729_o.jpg\" \/>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wir danken <a href=\"https:\/\/www.puzzle.ch\/de\/\" target=\"_blank\">Puzzle itc<\/a> f\u00fcr Kaffee &amp; Gipfeli, dem&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/bern.impacthub.net\" target=\"_blank\">Impact Hub<\/a> f\u00fcr ihre Gastfreundschaft und <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valiant.ch\/privatkunden\" target=\"_blank\">Valiant<\/a> f\u00fcrs Sponsoring des Anlasses, inklusive lila Sch\u00f6ggeli.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/socialmediagipfel\/sets\/72157686274526343\" target=\"_blank\">Hier<\/a> finden Sie Bilder von <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boris-baldinger.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Boris Baldinger<\/a> vom 40.

There are multiple reasons for this. The most important, however, is quite simply explained: We wanted to focus our energy on the parts of the Schema that seemed most important to us, which are Content Entities. However, with Content Entities there are also technical challenges to overcome. Exposing the whole configuration data graph in our Schema would inflate our Schema by a significant margin. Hence, we will need a user interface and a configuration structure (inception) to allow users to choose which parts of the configuration should be exposed. As a first step, we will focus on <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/fubhy\/graphql-drupal\/issues\/64\">exposing Configuration Entities<\/a> only.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Expand support for Views<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While we do already support Views through a special Display Plugin that allows for reuses of the existing schema for any exposed any entity types we currently do not support custom field configuration in Views. This means that currently, you cannot leverage the full flexibility of field based displays in Views. <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/fubhy\/graphql-drupal\/issues\/83\">We are planning to add this capability<\/a> to the Views integration module. Each View configured this way would generate its own type within the Schema where every configured field would simply be exposed as a string.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Improve Test Coverage<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While we already do have relatively good test coverage compared to most contribute Drupal modules, we want to further improve on this. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazeelabs.com\/en\/philipp-melab\">Philipp<\/a> wrote a significant amount of test cases for the various integration modules (a round of applause for that). However, big and important parts of the core APIs of the base GraphQL module are currently not covered by any tests. There are various issues in our <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/fubhy\/graphql-drupal\/issues\">issue queue<\/a> which aim to address this problem. Recently, we\u2019ve also added test <a href=\"https:\/\/codecov.io\/gh\/fubhy\/graphql-drupal\">coverage reports<\/a>. If you are interested in lending a helping hand to work on this, just <a href=\"https:\/\/codecov.io\/gh\/fubhy\/graphql-drupal\/tree\/8.x-3.x\/src\">find a part of the code base that is currently not tested<\/a> and add a test case for it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Expose Actions as Mutations<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Drupal has a Core concept for Actions. While the Trigger module has been removed during the Drupal 8 release cycle, the concept of Actions and the backing code is still sitting around in Core. <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/fubhy\/graphql-drupal\/issues\/114\">Exposing Actions<\/a> should be a fairly simple undertaking and would allow us to expose a range of simple and specialized mutations instead of having to write custom Mutations using our internal APIs and adding the to the schema manually.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Expose Rules components as Mutations<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is another exciting feature I am looking forward to. <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/fubhy\/graphql-drupal\/issues\/115\">Adding configured Rules components as Mutations<\/a> would allow site builders to quickly configure and expose fully customized operations of any sort. This feature would prove especially useful to create more specialized<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mutations where exposing the full Schema of the underlying model would add unnecessary weight to the Schema or complicate the implementation on the consumer side. This feature is planned for the future but currently not on the roadmap for our first stable release.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Add a full graph based configuration interface and schema<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is by far the most exciting gem on our long term roadmap. More on this in a separate post.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>First stable release<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are going to work on stabilizing the module further while also working on some of the aforementioned features during the upcoming days and weeks. We\u2019ve scheduled the release of the first stable version of the module for the 25th of September. This is one day before the official start of <a href=\"https:\/\/events.drupal.org\/vienna2017\">DrupalCon Vienna<\/a> and the day on which Philipp and I will be presenting about the GraphQL &amp; Drupal Lovestory at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Drupal-Austria\/events\/242918946\/?eventId=242918946\">Drupal Publishing Summit<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Let\u2019s talk about it in Vienna<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Both Philipp and I are going to attend DrupalCon, at least partly.

The lucky rest took the party inside. Just like any typical BBQ, we had lot\u2019s of finger food, meats, salads and to top that off, there was beer we could draw from kegs, wine, a watermelon punch and Gasparini ice cream.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We had all kinds of surprises setting-up for the BBQ. It\u2019s probably best if you let me take you through the tour. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>First up<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Victor suggested two Zurich based musicians, Stephan and Alejandro, of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hermanosgutierrez.ch\">Hermanos Guti\u00e9rrez<\/a>&nbsp;for our evening's entertainment. They played for us all night, and they were truly incredible.<\/p>\r\n<img alt=\"Hermanos Guit\u00e9rrez\" data-align=\"center\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"709b0335-8063-4885-b323-351bc60a2794\" src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/inline-images\/BBA_1270.jpg\" \/>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They play purely instrumental Latin soul music, which provided the perfect atmosphere. A satisfied Victor declared that: \u201cIt was truly great, made the whole evening sublime.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The ambiance they created, did, as a matter of fact, put everyone in just the right mood to relax, enjoy the feast, chat and explore some new technologies.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>My favorite exploration<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As one of the minds behind Zurich\u2019s TEDx chapter, our CEO and Partner, Urs Bucher, got Dr. Patrick K\u00fcnzler to show off <a href=\"http:\/\/www.limbic-life.com\/en\/the-chair.html\">the Limbic Chair<\/a>, not just in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pGiqq12mdUs\">TEDx talk<\/a>, but also at our BBQ.<\/p>\r\n<img alt=\"A person testing VR and the Limbic Chair\" data-align=\"center\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"22f8b299-ddd3-44f2-b109-9be96741983e\" src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/inline-images\/BBA_1067.jpg\" \/>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now let me tell you. This chair is really something else. According to Dr. Patrick K\u00fcnzler, research shows that walking and movement is better for you than standing or sitting. In this chair, you move constantly.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That sounds uncomfortable, right? It isn\u2019t.&nbsp;Instead, it feels like you\u2019re floating. When trying it, you could actually wear VR glasses and play a game, in which you navigate by just by moving your legs. To me, that was the craziest part of the evening.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What I wish we could have seen<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the cool things we planned was the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dji.com\/mavic\">Dji Mavic<\/a> in combo with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dji.com\/dji-goggles\/info\">Dji Goggles<\/a>. The Dji Mavic is a photography and videography drone, that follows you around using satellite information. Even though it is very small, it has epic features, including 5 vision sensors that recognize any obstacles and a 4K camera stabilized by a 3-axis mechanical gimbal.

Now we can request the page title for every internal URL. But menus and link fields can also store <em>external<\/em> addresses.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWouldn't it be cool if we can request their page title's just the same way?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Overriding a field<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Let's try it and ask questions later:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>query {\r\n  route(path: \"http:\/\/www.drupal.org\") {\r\n    pageTitle\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, this doesn't work out. The route field checks if the provided path is a Drupal route and if the user has access to it, and will return null if either of the two doesn't apply. So, the first thing we will do is <em>extend<\/em> the route field so it also can handle external URLs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Note:<\/strong> At the time of writing there is a pending pull request that adds exactly this enhancement. If you are reading this in a couple of weeks from now (my now, not yours - unless you own a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/DeLorean_DMC-12\">DeLorean<\/a>), there's a chance that this already works for you. But since this is a nice example of overriding a field, we stick with it. If you don't just want to read but really play through this tutorial, make sure you work based on the <strong>8.x-3.0-alpha3<\/strong> version of the GraphQL module.<\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>We create a new field called <em>ExampleRoute<\/em> in our <code>graphql_example<\/code> module. If you are not yet proud owner of one, please refer to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazeelabs.com\/en\/blog\/extending-graphql-part1-fields\">last blog post<\/a>. This new field simply extends the existing <code>Route<\/code> field and even copies its annotation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>With one difference: We add a new property called <code>weight<\/code> which we set to \"1\". It's quite simple. When the schema builder assembles all field plugins for a given type and stumbles upon two with the same name, the higher weight takes precedence. That's how we tell GraphQL to use our custom implementation of a field.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <code>resolveValues<\/code> method checks if the path is an external Url. In this case, it just constructs a Url object, else it will pass down to the parent implementation.<\/p>\r\n<script src=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/pmelab\/d0b62d94873bc763a4ef9dc283a4c894.js\"><\/script>\r\n\r\n<p>The result is still not satisfying. The <code>route<\/code> field now returns an Url object, but our page title field can only retrieve internal page titles.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>So let's modify the <code>PageTitle<\/code> field. First, we check if the current value is a <em>routed<\/em>&nbsp;URL. In this case, we still leave it to the title resolver. Otherwise, we fire up Drupal's <code>http_client<\/code> (aka Guzzle), fetch the content behind the address, load it into an XML document, search for the <code>title<\/code> element and yield its contents. I am aware that this is not the most performant solution, but I'm trying to keep these examples short and concise.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It worked. Our query for an external page title yields the correct result.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>{\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"route\": {\r\n      \"pageTitle\": \"Drupal - Open Source CMS | Drupal.org\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\r\n\r\n<p>The result is correct, but it doesn't feel right. Internal and external URLs are fundamentally different. The page title might make sense on both, but the similarities end there. External URLs won't route to an entity or provide any other information specific to Drupal. These fields won't break and will just return <code>NULL<\/code> instead, but that doesn't seem very elegant.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Diff:<\/em> <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/pmelab\/graphql-drupal-example\/commit\/b2d87d525b51bf98d5faf058f3b0d5327ec129d1\">Page title of external URLs<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Interfaces and Types<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We have already met the <code>Url<\/code> type, and we know that it connects a certain value with a list of fields that can be executed on it. A GraphQL interface is in some ways similar to interfaces in an object oriented language. It gives a group of types with shared fields a common name.<br \/>\r\nRight now we've got the <code>Url<\/code> type provided by the GraphQL module, representing internal URLs (not 100% true, but for the sake of simplicity we leave it there). And we have our <em>external<\/em> URL which is emitted by the same <code>route<\/code> field, but operates differently. So what we need to do now:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Create a GraphQL interface called <code>GenericUrl<\/code><\/li>\r\n\t<li>Change the <code>route<\/code> field to return this interface instead.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Attach our <code>pageTitle<\/code> field to this interface.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Add a <code>ExternalUrl<\/code> GraphQL type that implements this interface.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>Creating the interface<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>GraphQL interfaces live in their own plugin namespace <code>Plugin\\GraphQL\\Interfaces<\/code> where the schema builder will pick them up.<\/p>\r\n<script src=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/pmelab\/d8b4bf8c669dc13a475064f5fbbd01af.js\"><\/script>\r\n\r\n<p>The plugin annotation for interfaces is quite simple. In most cases, it consists of the plugin id and a name to be used within the schema. The base class for interfaces contains an abstract method: <code>resolveType<\/code>. This method will receive a runtime value and has to select the appropriate GraphQL type for it. In our case, it checks if the URL is external or not and uses the schema manager service to return an instance of either <code>Url<\/code> or <code>ExternalUrl<\/code>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Using the interface<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This won't have any effect as long as we don't use this interface type somewhere. So we change the <code>pageTitle<\/code> field to attach it to the <code>GenericUrl<\/code> instead of <code>Url<\/code> and adapt our override of the <code>route<\/code> field to return a <code>GenericUrl<\/code>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Creating the new type<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The new type we need is rather simple. It's an empty class, extending <code>TypePluginBase<\/code>. The most important part is the annotation that defines a list of interfaces. Just the <code>GenericUrl<\/code> interface in our case.<\/p>\r\n<script src=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/pmelab\/13918663ddf4a5a99fdfa13388661a8f.js\"><\/script>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>GraphQL type source<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Diff:<\/em> <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/pmelab\/graphql-drupal-example\/commit\/53059f2dea792e290a0e456b45674f7efe07d858\">Generic Url interfaces<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now our query still works. But there is a new problem. Internal URLs don't work anymore&nbsp;but emit an error message instead:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>Type \"Url\" does not implement \"GenericUrl\"\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\r\n\r\n<p>We need to adapt the of the <code>Url<\/code> type, which is defined in another module. Sounds like a job for the hero we don't deserve, but we need right now. You can't say Drupal without screaming <strong>hook_alter<\/strong> from the top of your lungs!<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Altering plugins<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There's an alter hook for each plugin type in GraphQL. So, all we need is to implement <code>hook_graphql_types_alter<\/code> and add the <code>GenericUrl<\/code> interface to the <code>Url<\/code> types interface list.<br \/>\r\nNote that the types are indexed by their plugin-ID.<\/p>\r\n<script src=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/pmelab\/627af5cdab17c295622ec517427f5360.js\"><\/script>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Diff:<\/em> <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/pmelab\/graphql-drupal-example\/commit\/2dd8dfdd59669b847a05479c5bf5d9d309e68176\">Altering existing plugins<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Great! Now we are able to fetch page titles from both internal and external urls.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>query {\r\n  admin:route(path: \"\/admin\") {\r\n    pageTitle\r\n  }\r\n  drupal:route(path: \"http:\/\/www.drupal.org\") {\r\n    pageTitle\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Will return:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>{\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"admin\": {\r\n      \"pageTitle\": \"Administration\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"drupal\": {\r\n      \"pageTitle\": \"Drupal - Open Source CMS | Drupal.org\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\r\n\r\n<p>But you will notice that we lost all the other fields attached to the <code>Url<\/code> type. Thats because they are not attached to the <code>GenericUrl<\/code> type, but to the <code>Url<\/code> type. And that makes sense, since you can't request for example an entity or the current user context for an external path.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Query composition and fragment selection<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>And this brings us to the most important and powerful aspect of interfaces and types. We are able to apply different query fragments and fetch different information based on the result type.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Assume the following scenario: Our <em>Article<\/em> type has a <em>Links<\/em> field that can contain links to either other articles or external URLs, as well as a <em>Description<\/em> field. Additionally, we extended our <code>ExternalUrl<\/code> type with an additional <code>meta<\/code> field that pulls meta tags out of the XML tree (<em>Bonus objective:<\/em> implement that yourself). Now we could do this:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>query {\r\n  route(path: \"\/node\/1\") {\r\n    ... on Url {\r\n      nodeContext {\r\n        ... on NodeArticle {\r\n          fieldLinks {\r\n            url {\r\n              pageTitle\r\n              ...InternalLink\r\n              ...ExternalLink\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfragment InternalLink on Url {\r\n  nodeContext {\r\n    ... on NodeArticle {\r\n      description:fieldDescription\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfragment ExternalLink on ExternalUrl {\r\n  description:meta(property: \"og:description\")  \r\n}\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\r\n\r\n<p>The first part simply routes to the article with id 1 and fetches it's <em>Links<\/em> field, which will emit a list of URLs that might be internal or external. There we first pull the common page title and then include two fragments that apply on either type of URL and invoke different fields based on that information. So elegant!<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The finish line<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We've reached the (preliminary) end of our streak of practical GraphQL blog posts.
