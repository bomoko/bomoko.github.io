And, even more basic: How can we as a greater community have _any_ impact _at all_ on this broader social issue?\r\n\r\nThe action steps and executive summaries of those discussions and of this write-up contain good learning (e.g. many don't dare to propose a session because they think they can't really make a contribution in terms of level or topic); but they also are quite \u2026 well, either inconsistent or incomplete or imprecise on those core questions. For example: We said it looks like it's important to \"provide safe spaces\" for minorities (sounds good on it's own, needs to be fleshed out), while e.g. the write-up's declared role model of JSConf'2012 states that \"you need to avoid treating them in a special way.\" This is only one example of how we a) are not nailing it by either missing some pieces or being imprecise and b) don't really know what to do because c) we are simply missing data and expertise on those matters.\r\n\r\nI'd like to know (as we all do): What measures really foster diversity in a community like ours (global, distributed, special-interest, heterogenous in some dimensions, too homogenous in others)? Currently, we simply lack that data. Is it out there?\r\nHow can we get it, and get in more expertise on diversity?\r\n\r\nLet's of course start with what we currently see as decent steps, like provide safe spaces, offering encouragement and mentoring, and \u2013 probably most important \u2013 actively reaching out to minorities, including e.g. refugees (like undpaul did and told us about in their inspiring session given by Anja and their new Iranian employee).\r\n\r\nAnd while we start with something let's try to get reliable _data_ in.\r\n\r\n","field_comment_name":"Daniel","field_email_address":"daniel.nolde@wunder.io","field_subscribe_to_our_newslette":"0"},{"cid":"1424","uuid":"23c72397-36bf-4fb4-b100-ef15a5ce8636","pid":[],"entity_id":[{"target_id":"1332","url":"\/en\/diversity-matters"}],"langcode":"en","subject":"This positive discrimination\u2026","uid":[{"target_id":"0","url":"\/en\/user\/0"}],"name":[],"mail":[],"homepage":[],"created":"1481198150","changed":"1481198150","status":"1","thread":"02\/","entity_type":"node","comment_type":[{"target_id":"comment"}],"field_name":"comment","default_langcode":"1","comment_body":"This positive discrimination \"because of\" (get what you want) is bullshit.

I've been a track chair for DrupalCons and DrupalCamps for multiple years and selected hundreds of sessions from thousand of submissions. In my experience the example you mention here \"have 3 sessions proposals but only 2 slots\" just does not reflect the real world.  If you end up in such an situation as a conference organiser you have much bigger problems than diversity and probably should think about not doing the event at all.\r\nIn my experience you have many more sessions to choose then slots, which means you already have a hard time too choose which one is the right one. Plus you do not know which sessions are \"great\" and which one are \"poor\" in advantage, you can read the session description and look at the experience of the speakers, but I've seen great speakers giving horrible sessions and vice versa.\r\nSo I'm sorry, your \"simple example\" is very very wrong, because you never have all the informations you would like to have.\r\nA good real life example would be: You have 10 slots and around 50 session proposals. 95% if the session proposals are white-male and 5% of non-white-male. I think yes it's perfectly fine to give only 70% slots to the white-male and 30% to the non-white-male (or in a 80\/20 % ratio, whatever you and the organisers team decide).\r\n\r\nI can explain you more on how these things work, also in related to hiring.

Maybe better could be \"assumptions\" or \"prerequisites\" than \"skills\". Simple look at schools: how many girls WANT to go to school for car mechanics? And how many boys WANT  to go to school for nurses? They CAN. There are no obstacles. But there are some things which came from NATURE. Simply women are more oriented to family and other stuff. Nobody makes any obstacles at these times. I know about only one boy \"nurse\". Simply he loves his job. He can do it. Without any discrimination. But generally it is job which mostly WANT to do girls. Imagine woman as car mechanics - all guys in city will prefer her over others :-)\r\nI know about only few female programmers. They can do that because they want and they like technics, playing PC games, drones are interesting thing for them. I know many car mechanicals, carpenters and so - but no woman there(is that discrimination?).\r\n\r\nI am programmer. I can't imagine doing nurse. I love technics. My wife is nurse. She loves that kind of being (it is not only job). Computer is hell's device for her. I think this is majority. It is ok.\r\nIf any girl\/woman WANT to be programmer then she CAN. Nobody makes any problems about that. Ask anybody for job. Me personally will not ask you if you are girl, christian, vegan or other. I will ask you: and what are your skills? How can you help to our organisation? It is EQUAL.\r\n\r\nAny girl can go to IT university. Any girl can go to mechanical engineering faculty. When i was there ten years ago we had 2 girls in class of 30. They were not discriminated. They were great essence of group. Why only 2? Because it comes from their own mind, from some nature aspects of difference between man and woman. It is not \"programmer is BETTER than nurse\". It is \"programmer is DIFFERENT to nurse\".\r\n\r\nMostly everybody have full access to all knowledge in the world. If you are woman and you want be programmer you can simply learn it with youtube, laracasts, lullabot etc. I think nobody(at least in drupal community) will ever rate you by your sex.

Every culture is blind to the bias it has. In my personal opinion this is wrong, because it treas otherwise equal peopel differently for no valid reason. It also discourages equally skilled people who just do not fit the \"norm\" to contribute fully. In practise this means, that because the clear majority of presenters in (Drupal) events are male, there are not that many role models for \"other kind\" of people. It means we're not encouraging all people to contribute (deliver sessions, code, whatever), but only a subset of them.\r\n\r\nSecond reason is fully related to this effect. Just like @rachel_norfolk explained, if we are not providing equal opportunities for everyone, we're effectively throwing LOTS of knowledge an potential out of the window. Gender, sexual orientation, skin colour or religion have exactly nothing to do with the skills and potential any person has.\r\n\r\nI have not seen anyone suggesting, that we should start selecting sessions purely based on if someone is from a underrepresented group of people. Having a preference for example to select sessions with diversity as one of many factors means we get to see more women, more non-white and less \"perfectly healty white male middle aged hetero from USA or Europe\" -people on stage - and bring much much more potential with them into the community.","field_comment_name":"Perttu Ehn @ropsue","field_email_address":"ropsu@iki.fi","field_subscribe_to_our_newslette":"0"},{"cid":"1433","uuid":"5bff8d33-200f-468d-8b00-b66728c8421a","pid":[{"target_id":"1430","url":"\/en\/comment\/1430"}],"entity_id":[{"target_id":"1332","url":"\/en\/diversity-matters"}],"langcode":"en","subject":"What i wanted to say: if you\u2026","uid":[{"target_id":"0","url":"\/en\/user\/0"}],"name":[],"mail":[],"homepage":[],"created":"1481204759","changed":"1481204759","status":"1","thread":"02.02.00\/","entity_type":"node","comment_type":[{"target_id":"comment"}],"field_name":"comment","default_langcode":"1","comment_body":"What i wanted to say: if you have to decide for proposals you do not judge by male\/female, skin colour, vegan or others.

We\u2019re often not getting it. Can we change this without discrimination?\r\n\r\n> From my personal experience, bringing in diversity into tech events is a challenge, especially\r\n> when they are organized by teams that aren\u2019t diverse in the first place.\r\n\r\nJam in his introduction to the BoF mentioned he\u2019d been to Drupal camps the world over and said something to the effect that the lack of diversity at Drupal events is a greater problem in Western Europe.\r\n\r\nAre we special? Is it worse here?\r\n\r\nIt seems Jam\u2019s anecdote is supported by statistics for our broader industry. My feeling has always been that the Drupal community is more diverse than other Tech communities that I\u2019ve experienced. Within Europe (High-tech knowledge Intensive Services \u2013 which includes computer programming and consultancy) is 30.4% women. It\u2019s not completely the East\/West split, but broadly. Germany, where we were, is actually stand out \u2018good\u2019 at 33.4%. As a resident of the Netherlands, I feel I have to sadly mention, it has the worst ratio of the whole of Europe with only 22.6%\r\nhttp:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/eurostat\/statistics-explained\/images\/3\/33\/Employment_in_high-tech_sectors%2C_EU-28_and_selected_countries%2C_2015.PNG \r\nFurther round the world it seems R&D could be correlated and http:\/\/uis.unesco.org\/sites\/default\/files\/documents\/fs34-women-in-science-2015-en.pdf Europe is pretty awful.\r\n\r\nWithin Drupal we don\u2019t discriminate. We just pick the best from the talks submitted by the people in our industry.\r\n\r\nIt still doesn\u2019t add up! \r\n\r\nWith the shitty percentages in most Western European countries, we\u2019re still failing. We must be discriminating in a negative way somehow.\r\n\r\nAre all the best talks really from men? Maybe all the best talks submitted are from men. Unconscious bias will tell us what is best. We all do it, me, you, everyone, it\u2019s part of being human. We think that someone will be best to do something, and we know we\u2019re right. Without structurally working against this unconscious bias we\u2019re stuck with it. \r\nAnonymizing the process isn\u2019t the answer. In a connected & close community like ours it isn\u2019t an option. Even if it were possible, I\u2019m not sure it would be desirable. Getting to speak isn\u2019t some competition where the best proposal-writer wins. It\u2019s about co-operating to make the best possible conference for everyone attending. \r\nIt\u2019s may be better to having more people, and more diverse people, making the selection.\r\n\r\nThe people submitting talks aren\u2019t representative. It\u2019s not as diverse as our community. Unless men truly are the best to be speaking. We don\u2019t need positive discrimination for this. We need to fix a broken process.\r\n\r\nHow? The first comment mentioned the answer is \u2018incomplete or imprecise\u2019. I\u2019d go so far as to say it\u2019s contradictory. What feels a safe space differs. Our sample set is so diverse that data, as such, isn\u2019t going to be that great. It\u2019s a process based on social relations.\r\n\r\nLuckily there are lots of experiences written up about things that worked, and didn\u2019t. Some are collected at the bottom of the notes from the BoF, and by the Diversity group, and others in this discussion. We should try them.\r\n\r\nFind processes that don\u2019t discriminate is not positive discrimination. Personally I\u2019d go further and say we should positively and actively go out of our way to break the discrimination that means there are only 20 \u2013 30% women in our industry. Maybe we can discuss that when we\u2019re getting close to involving the diversity in our conferences as in the industry, maybe by then we\u2019ll already have started.\r\n\r\nInvolving a diverse group of people from the start is one of the common successes written up. I come back to the quote from Josef above. With volunteers it is difficult, some people have more time, some have other commitments - all true. We need to work out how to make our teams more diverse. Can the way the team organizes be different? Make it easier, or more inviting, for more people to participate at this level? The diverse team is clearly something others found helps.\r\n\r\nAs a community we need to give space for the diverse voices and ideas that already exist. If our structures, or our behavior, prevents this, that is discrimination. After my earlier tweets (linked in the article) I made a personal decision to at least try and amplify the voices of women involved in the community, rather than my own. Having now joined in again with this, I feel it\u2019s important to do this again.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re a diverse community, but not so diverse as we should or could be. We have all sorts of unconscious personal bias, and live in society with its biases. Our camps don\u2019t always involve, or reflect, who we are. Some voices dominate.

In their eyes, being racist or sexist requires overt hatred of a particular group, and as they do not feel any hatred, they consider the label to be incorrect and the complaints to be arbitrary.\r\n\r\nTechnology has a mindset associated with it that a lot of people subscribe to; the best ideas float to the top, and knowledge and skill are coveted above all else. Because on the internet we're just a username - often a racially and sexually ambiguous username that says nothing about our physical characteristics - our code contributions are all that anyone sees, and code either works or it doesn't and it's either fast or slow. \r\n\r\nTherefore, it must be the case that technology communities suffer from fewer social problems seen offline, if they have any at all.\r\n\r\nBut this suggests that people are completely aware of their own unconscious biases, and completely objective, which is absurd. It doesn't translate to offline meet-ups and events.\r\n\r\nI think it's important to reassure members of the community that they are not being attacked and assumed to be card-carrying members of the KKK, but instead that they may not have noticed how small things could contribute to an atmosphere that might not overtly reject certain types of people, but could be unwelcoming for entirely-preventable reasons.\r\n\r\nIt's not about excluding white people or men, but about encouraging people who differ from that stereotype to be welcomed, as otherwise they just won't bother coming.\r\n\r\nIt just seems more egalitarian to shape events to make them more welcoming of everybody. Not giving special treatment to anyone. Just removing obstacles.

There are a plethora of training events across the tech universe.  I choose which to learn from based upon the quality of the presentation, not the gender.   Always.  I do not have the leisure time in business to trade my time for less-than-the-very-best information.  If you have done a RFP and promotion that is widely and fairly distributed to a population of interested speakers who include both female and male, at some point, it becomes a female's responsibility to step up.  It's not Drupal's job to coddle my female colleagues.  Treat us as equals and provide us an equal opportunity -- that is the behavior I would anticipate.\r\n\r\nWhile many fail to acknowledge it, the truth is that there is women do have different interests than men.  I fish.  And yes, I am a huntress.  I am a backpacker.  I ski. I ride horses.  I code.  And I find it the rare young woman or middle-aged woman (forget my age group) who thinks it is cool to dig deep into code.  Sure they exist.  But let's not be overly zealous in forcing women to feel bad about digging into something they do not want to dig into.  Respect their right to choose professions that delight them.\r\n\r\nDo I support more coding training in schools?  You bet.  Do I want dojo coding in every rural town and metro market where those who want it can take advantage of it?  Of course.   I also have a friend at a university who leads a STEM program.   It's a battle to get the girls into some aspects of STEM. \r\n\r\nThe magazine?  Well, a bit tacky but understandable.  Was there a female bag and a male bag?  Maybe that could have been provided. \r\n\r\nBut, please, it's better than good to assure that the opportunities to do the steep climb to Drupal be available to women.  But please don't get so stuck on diversity that in the process you make women feel bad for not choosing to want a life in front of a computer screen as I have chosen.  \r\n\r\nAnd safe spaces?  Well, I noticed a long time ago that I learned more from my scabs than I ever learned from a party.  Don't protect people from developing a thick skin.

Learning how to move beyond tolerance and into inclusion in these two realms will lead to greater inclusivity in other realms. Also, I feel like we treat this stuff with such a clinical mindset. We are all people. We need to learn how to open our hearts to each other and hear each other's stories and experiences.

I'm too old (35) and I've worked too hard to work with teams and people that aren't diverse, I can't count the number of jobs and organisations I just wouldn't bother applying for. I've spoken to a bunch of men and they feel the same way too. I can't help but think that most guys in Drupal I know would have been way more impressed with a Permaculture Weekly or Veganism Rules or so many other magazines and just tossed Playboy in the bin. Whether they commented or tweeted or not the collective facepalms vibrated across the world. \r\n\r\nI do know I probably won't get a look in with recruiters  and businesses that push the \"work hard play hard\" tech boy club culture - but I know guys that have zero interest too. More fool to them - I'm awesome. \r\n\r\nI worked in a company that built in Drupal with no connection to the community (to their detriment in part why they closed at the start of the year) so it's very interesting witnessing the community as a person who builds in Drupal with no connections observing how it works and trying to assess entry points and possible place in a community that is reasonably advanced. \r\n\r\nI am very concerned about Drupal 8 - and the points you make are the ones I connect with most Dianne - I'd absolutely go to that conference you speak of to have an honest discussion and assessment of the future - and I would only go if there were a diverse array of voices and people part of a community going forward. I don't know with what level of confidence I would build in D8 and if and which organisations or businesses I would encourage to build in it and with whom - and that feels to me like a major problem. Having said that I'm building a site in D8 at the moment and I'm ore than happy to test and explore, but I am critically evaluating other platforms - which honestly I'd rather not do. \r\n\r\nAnd then there are the people who actually pay the money for stuff. These businesses and organisations are working very hard to diversify - or they probably already are. When they don't see that in a tech company or community they take their cash else ware. The story and inclusiveness of open source is part of the narrative we sell as open source developers, when others sell and prove that they do that better market lead is lost. Business is all about supporting more women and diversity in tech right now. It's something looked at in procurement - and more and more it's women with technical knowledge that are making company decisions on purchases. If you can't sell to them they will go else ware - it doesn't really matter how on trend your opinions on diversity are or aren't.\r\n\r\nok_lyndsey","field_comment_name":"Lyndsey","field_email_address":"jackson.lyndsey@gmail.com","field_subscribe_to_our_newslette":"0"},{"cid":"1460","uuid":"c9ce7321-c991-4e56-b801-1cb6041364d9","pid":[{"target_id":"1457","url":"\/en\/comment\/1457"}],"entity_id":[{"target_id":"1332","url":"\/en\/diversity-matters"}],"langcode":"en","subject":"I generally agree with this\u2026","uid":[{"target_id":"0","url":"\/en\/user\/0"}],"name":[],"mail":[],"homepage":[],"created":"1481843414","changed":"1481843414","status":"1","thread":"0e.00\/","entity_type":"node","comment_type":[{"target_id":"comment"}],"field_name":"comment","default_langcode":"1","comment_body":"I generally agree with this Sunshiney except that the world is now moving so hard and fast towards tech that without women being more engaged in tech I feel we will exacerbate social and economic divides.

Probably a website where you can buy products of some sort. Websites where you can rent, say, a tool, a car or a room are special use cases that account for a small percentage of the e-commerce landscape. If you think about it for a minute, you'll also realize that the worflow is very different. Generally speaking, when one buys something it's for ever (one lane, one way). But when one rents it's for a limited time and when this time expires, the object needs to be returned; and until it is returned it cannot be rented out to someone else (multi-lane, two ways). Building a standard end-to-end e-commerce website is hard. As you can probably imagine, building an end-to-end rental store is beyond challenging. In this session, we'll look at those challenges in more details and see what's possible with Drupal contrib modules.","field_comment_name":"Renaud Joubert","field_email_address":"bisonbleu@sympatico.ca","field_subscribe_to_our_newslette":"1"},{"cid":"1654","uuid":"fa3552ee-a773-4620-9e00-f916aa8336a0","pid":[{"target_id":"1649","url":"\/en\/comment\/1649"}],"entity_id":[{"target_id":"1426","url":"\/en\/blog\/submit-site-building-session-drupalcon-vienna"}],"langcode":"en","subject":"hi renaud, thanks for\u2026","uid":[{"target_id":"0","url":"\/en\/user\/0"}],"name":[],"mail":[],"homepage":[],"created":"1499074392","changed":"1499074392","status":"1","thread":"01.00\/","entity_type":"node","comment_type":[{"target_id":"comment"}],"field_name":"comment","default_langcode":"1","comment_body":"hi renaud, thanks for commenting and stepping up for a session! unfortunately the submission deadline is now over + presentations would be required to be done in person at the conference. maybe you would like to submit to a conference in your region? a good place to find them is https:\/\/www.drupical.com\/ best josef","field_comment_name":"Josef","field_email_address":"josef@amazeelabs.com","field_subscribe_to_our_newslette":"0"},{"cid":"1710","uuid":"f2ddaac6-d89b-4cce-804f-797b4d9094ce","pid":[],"entity_id":[{"target_id":"1439","url":"\/en\/blog\/welcome-kristy"}],"langcode":"en","subject":"Kristy, welcome.

Could React use Drupal's REST capabilities to get the data? Absolutely! React does not impose a specific way of getting the data. As long as you can feed your components with data, React will work. In this particular example, you can see how at the top of the blog post I pass a dummy articles array which contains some test data. Now, instead of hardcoding that data you could make a request to an endpoint which can return a json, you parse it, and that's it.\r\n2. What are the benefits of Apollo and GraphQL? I will point out the benefits of GraphQL, since Apollo is just a tool that queries the server using the GraphQL syntax. The main benefits are:\r\n- allows the frontend to ask only for the data which it really needs. No more, no less. This translates into traffic optimization, which is always good for mobile.\r\n- you can have more frontends which use the same backend and each one could ask for different data. Now, if you want to refactor one of the frontends, if you would use REST, it could be that you may also have to change the structure of the json output (the happy case is when you only need to add new fields) so it has a side effect on the other frontends. With GraphQL, you do the changes only in that particular frontend.\r\n- can save you from doing more roundtrip requests. For example: if you want to display the articles of an user (with more details), with REST you usually ask first for the user profile from where you can access a list of articles, then you do a request to get the data for each article. Of course, you could optimize this by having a specialized endpoint that returns that specific list, with those specific fields. But then what if you have to display the same list but with other fields in some other part of your app. And if you have multiple frontends... you will start to create a very complex and complicated REST server. One that can be used ONLY for those frontends.\r\n\r\nAnd the list could continue, but in my opinion the top 2 benefits of GraphQL over REST are:\r\n- you truly decouple the frontend and the backend. The frontend is the one who decides what kind of data (and how much) it wants, not the backend. Which makes frontend refactoring much easier.\r\n- the amount of data sent over the network (and the number of requests) can be reduced a lot.\r\n\r\nI also suggest to checkout this video: https:\/\/www.howtographql.com\/basics\/1-graphql-is-the-better-rest\/","field_comment_name":"Vasi","field_email_address":"vasile.chindris@amazee.com","field_subscribe_to_our_newslette":"0"},{"cid":"1762","uuid":"3b80734a-75b0-4248-a04e-782fadcb9274","pid":[],"entity_id":[{"target_id":"1440","url":"\/en\/blog\/drupal-graphql-react-apollo"}],"langcode":"en","subject":"Thanks for this super\u2026","uid":[{"target_id":"0","url":"\/en\/user\/0"}],"name":[],"mail":[],"homepage":[],"created":"1502369524","changed":"1502369524","status":"1","thread":"02\/","entity_type":"node","comment_type":[{"target_id":"comment"}],"field_name":"comment","default_langcode":"1","comment_body":"Thanks for this super helpful tutorial!
